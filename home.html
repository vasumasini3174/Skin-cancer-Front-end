            <h2>About Skin Cancer</h2>
            <p>
                Skin cancer is the abnormal growth of skin cells, most often developing on skin exposed to the sun. Early detection and diagnosis are crucial for effective treatment and better outcomes.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC):</strong> The most common type, usually appears as a slightly transparent bump on the skin. It rarely spreads but can cause local damage if untreated.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC):</strong> Often appears as a firm, red nodule or a flat lesion with a scaly, crusted surface. It can spread to other parts of the body if not treated early.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Melanoma:</strong> The most serious type, can develop anywhere on the body. It often appears as a new, unusual growth or a change in an existing mole. Early detection is critical as melanoma can spread rapidly.
